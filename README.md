# Responsive Redesign

I messed up and redesigned IVE's site without really looking at the rubric items, and it did not really fit the criteria so I chose 99 Ranch Market. Turns out this contained a lot of interactive elements which took me far too long to code. Discovered a new trick which is to just use font-size: max(Xrem, Xvw), scales really well with different screen sizes and browser font settings, then use em's to pad these elements.
